## Analytics

You may want to track the number of visitors you receive to your blog/website in order to understand trends and popular posts/pages you've created.  

There are a number of providers out there one could use, including web hosts such as  
- [vercel](https://vercel.com/analytics),  
- [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/products/analytics/)  
- and [cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/).  

This theme/template doesn't include a specific solution due to there being a number of use cases and/or options which some people may or may not use.  


You may be asked to included a snippet inside the **HEAD** tag of your website when setting it up, which can be found in `src/layouts/Base.astro`.  
Alternatively, you could add the snippet in `src/components/BaseHead.astro`.  


Another popular provider is google analytics which you could integrate via the above method, or,  
for example adding [astro-google-analytics](https://www.npmjs.com/package/astro-google-analytics)  

## Deploy

[Astro docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/) has a great section and breakdown of how to deploy your own Astro site on various platforms and their idiosyncrasies.  

By default the site will be built (see [Commands](#commands) section above) to a `/dist` directory.
