## Pagefind search

This integration brings a static search feature for searching blog posts.  
In its current form, pagefind only works once the site has been built.  
This theme adds a postbuild script that should be run after Astro has built the site.  
You can preview locally by running both build && postbuild.  

Search results only includes blog posts. 
If you would like to include other/all your pages,  
remove/re-locate the attribute `data-pagefind-body`  
to the article tag found in `src/layouts/BlogPost.astro`.  

It also allows you to filter posts by tags added in the frontmatter of blog posts.  
If you would rather remove this, remove the data attribute `data-pagefind-filter="tag"` from the link in `src/components/blog/Hero.astro`.  

If you would rather not include this integration, simply remove the component `src/components/Search.astro`, and uninstall both `@pagefind/default-ui` & `pagefind` from package.json.  
You will also need to remove the postbuild script from here as well.  

You can reduce the initial css payload of your css, as demonstrated [here](https://github.com/chrismwilliams/astro-theme-cactus/pull/145#issue-1943779868),  
by lazy loading the web components styles.
